    <p>It was a dark and stormy night...</p>
    <p>And then it stopped raining.  The sun came out, and rainbow-colored unicorns magically appeared vomiting out lollipops.</p>
    <p>And then the <strong>zombie</strong> apocalypse started.<p>
    <p>But it came with a free frogurt.</p>
    <p>But the frogurt was not made of frozen yogurt. It was made of frogs. The frogs jumped out of the cone.</p>
